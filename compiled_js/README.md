# Compiled JavaScript Code

To execute the code, use node.js to run the `silly-lang.js` file.

Then, the program will ask for a file. Input the name/path of the file you want to execute.

*Note: When the program ends, it imediatly closes, so it's recomended to be ran in the terminal.*
*Another Note: this program was compiled on Windows 10. If any problem ocurs in any other OS, try to recompile (or ask ChatGpt).*
